# TheMostDangerousGame
This is a software project developed by Erick Lim and Gabriela Onelli.
The project is a video-game in an HTML web browser and powered using Javascript, in the same manner as the Google Dinasaur game. The user will play a character running to the right of the screen, jumping and ducking under obstacles.
